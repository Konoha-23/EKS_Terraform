Dynamic Provisioning
With This Setup, you do not need to have a persistent volume setup as that will be done via the storage class that has been setup.

apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-pvc
  #namespace:
spec:
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 15Gi #Amount of storage being claimed for use by designated POD in deployment
  storageClassName: ebs-sc #Name of created storage class
  volumeMode: Filesystem #Default file system. Will create a file system layer in block storage
  accessModes: #ReadWriteOnce - RWO(the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node), ReadOnlyMany - ROX (the volume can be mounted as read-only by many nodes), ReadWriteMany - RWX(the volume can be mounted as read-write by many nodes).
    - ReadWriteOnce

Static Provisioning. In this setup, the volume claim is dependent on an existing volume/volumes being available in the cluster.
